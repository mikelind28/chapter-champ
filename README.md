## Challenges

Some of the challenges we faced during the project was ensuring we build our application that is responsive and intuitive UI/UX across both desktop and mobile platforms. Besides that we had to learn Material UI at a faster pace.

## Future Implementation

Introduce more gamification features: badges, rewards, track number of pages read.
Social features: add friends, comments, book recommendations.
Ability to sort and filter my books by genre, author.
Ability to promote the user to Admin and assist with reset password.
