## Description

Are you tired of seeing half-finished books on your shelf? Tired of forgetting the book recommendations your friends give you? Tired of setting New Year's resolutions to read more, only to find yourself falling behind by February? Despair no more. ChapterChamp keeps all of your reading goals, all of your favorite books, and all of your progress right in one place. The intuitive search tool makes it easy to find what you're looking for. Then, simply curate your reading list and start accomplishing your reading goals one challenge at a time.

## Usage

Head over to our [ChapterChamp website](https://chapter-champ.onrender.com)! Then, simply click the LOGIN/SIGNUP button to create a new account or login to your existing account. 

Next, use the search bar to find a book that you want to add to your shelf. A user's shelf has four categories: Want to Read, Currently Reading, Finished Reading, and Favorites. Once you find your book, click its heart icon to add it to your Favorites. Otherwise, the three-dots present a drop-down menu, allowing a user to add the book to the Want to Read, Currently Reading, or Finished Reading sections of their shelf.

[***Add details about editing / removing books once functionality is in place]

[***Add a screenshot of the final application using the following format]:
